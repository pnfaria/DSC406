I am a professor at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia (Brazil) and I am also a Data Science Instructor at North Carolina State University (USA).
I really like statistics and being a teacher, so it is always great to be able to share what I have learned with my students.

In the DSC406 section , you will find information about the subjects I teach, including materials, suggestions related to mathematics and statistics, such as books, tutorials, 
videos and websites.
